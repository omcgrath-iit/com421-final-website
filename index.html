				Many do not know about their right to appeal their ticket, the chances of success, or how easy it is.
				Thousands of drivers every year enter bankruptcy from ticket debt for tickets they might not be liable for, simply because they did not know how to challenge it.
				Our mission is to change this by giving drivers the resources they need to get their ticket appealed.

				If someone you know has received a parking ticket, direct them to our site, where they can find the resources to appeal their ticket.
